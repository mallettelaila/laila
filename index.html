<h1>Laila Mallette-Fraser</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Laila. I am a journalism major born in Brooklyn. I was actually raised in Georgia, then later lived in Jamaica with my grandparents. I have always loved to travel and am very into art, mainly due to my grandfather being an artist
  They've always encouraged me to go for what I want and to explore new interests. After living so simplictically in Jamaica for almost a decade, coming back to New York was pretty overwhelming to be honest, but I'm determined to try as many new things as I can.
  I have very little experience with photography and photoshop, so I feel a little in over my head, but I am excited to try nontheless.</p>
