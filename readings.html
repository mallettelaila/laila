  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>In ‘On Photography’ by Susan Sotang, she argues that photographs do not fully encompass reality, rather only a fraction. There is no true way to capture reality in its purest form as a photograph gives a narrow picture of its subject. Photographs are art and art is always open to interpretation, no matter the intention of the artist. A photographer can have the best intentions when taking a photograph, but they are wired to think about angles, lighting, symmetry and other factors to get the best possible shot. Photographs tend to promote the ideal, the best possible version of something or someone, even if it isn’t a fully accurate representation of said subject. 
She goes on to explain how this leads into the constant need to memorialize important moments in one's life. While there is beauty in wanting to preserve experiences, at what point does one have experiences with the main intention to document them? At what point are we no longer living in the moment because we want to get the perfect shot?The camera has become a tool for people to distance themselves, whether consciously or subconsciously. You take a picture to show you are having a good time, but are you actually living in that moment? 
While I understand where Susan is coming from in terms of real-world issues regarding photographing being a form of bystanding, it is important for social and political issues to be documented. I agree no photo is worth a human life and intervention should not be a given in life or death circumstances, but photographs do provide visual proof that these events happened and can be used for future study. I think my main takeaway from the reading is that a photo can hold many meanings and capture many perspectives. They have the ability to capture a specific moment in time with the intention that it will be remembered in a specific way. 
As I work on these projects throughout the semester, I hope to provide many interesting perspectives through my work and hopefully leave a lasting impression. Technology and cameras have become so integral to everyday life, that the concept of capturing a moment has become second nature. The beauty of photography is that one is able to capture something that matters to them and preserve it anyway they choose. 
As I was reading the article, I realized I ironically don’t take a lot of pictures as I initially assumed. I can’t fully say it’s a conscious or subconscious choice to not document every vacation or big milestone, but it got me thinking on how people view life. I guess a part of me does prefer to live in the moment, but I do want to experiment and create something I would be able to look back on. I want to look back on the photos I will take this semester and be able to be transported back to the moment I took them. Photography is not just about documenting the past, but also about creating your own perspective.
